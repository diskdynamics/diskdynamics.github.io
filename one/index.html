<h1>Visualizing The Kinematics of Planet Formation</h1>
<h3>October 21 - 25, 2019 // CCA // Flatiron Institute // New York City</h3>

<p>
    With the Atacama Large (sub-)Millimeter Array, we are now routinely resolving
    substructure in protoplantetary disks highly suggestive of planet-disk interactions.
    Simultaneously we are seeing ever more evidence of kinematical structure in these
    disks, again suggestive of planet-disk interactions. This workshop is designed to
    bring together people working on both theoretical and observational aspects
    related to the kinematics of planet-disk interactions and to develop strategies
    to further advance the search for planets during their formation.

<h2>Registration of Interest</h2>

<p>
Please use this <a href="https://goo.gl/forms/irWRbfo26M7d6c2C2">Google form</a>
to register your interest in joining this workshop. As numbers are limited, if we
exceed the number of participants the SOC will attempt to select a diverse group
of participants with a breadth of scientific interests.
</p>


<h2>Schedule and Location</h2>

<p>
<i>Visualizing The Kinematics of Planet Formation</i> workshop will take place
from October 21 to October 25, 2019 at the <a href="https://www.simonsfoundation.org/flatiron/">Flatiron Institute</a>
in New York City.
</p>

<h2>Scientific Organizing Committee</h2>

<p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Phil Armitage</strong> (CCA)</li>
    <li><strong>Jaehan Bae</strong> (Carnegie DTM)</li>
    <li><strong>Ted Bergin</strong> (UMich)</li>
    <li><strong>Dan Foreman-Mackey</strong> (Flatiron)</li>
    <li><strong>Rich Teague</strong> (UMich/CfA)</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h2>Collaboration Policy</h2>

<p>

To ensure transparency and openness, we have adopted the
<a href="http://gaia.lol/codeofconduct.html">collaboration policy developed
for the Gaia Sprints</a> which has been used successfully in many similar
workshops. This policy requires that participants agree to the following:

</p><p>

All participants will be expected to openly share their ideas, expertise, code,
and interim results. Project development will proceed out in the open, among
participants and in the world.

</p><p>

Participants will be encouraged to change gears, start new collaborations, and
combine projects. Any participant who contributes significantly to a project
can expect co-authorship on resulting scientific papers, and any participant
who gets significant contributions to a project is expected to include those
contributors as co-authors.

</p><p>

These rules make it <i>inadvisable to bring proprietary data sets or
proprietary code</i>, unless the participant bringing such assets has the
rights to open them or add collaborators.

</p>

<h2 id="codeofconduct">Code of Conduct</h2>

<p>

We are dedicated to providing a harassment-free conference experience for
everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual

form. As such, we follow the <a href="https://aas.org/ethics">AAS Code of
