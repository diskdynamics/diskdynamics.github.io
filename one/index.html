<h1>Visualizing the Kinematics of Planet Formation</h1>
<h3>October 21 - 25, 2019 // CCA // Flatiron Institute // New York City</h3>

<p>
    We are now routinely resolving substructure in protoplanetary disks: gaps,
    rings and spirals highly suggestive of planet-disk interactions.
    Simultaneously we are seeing ever more evidence of kinematical structure in these
    disks, again suggestive of planet-disk interactions. This workshop is designed to
    bring together people working on both theoretical and observational aspects
    related to the kinematics of planet-disk interactions and to develop strategies
    to further advance the search for planets during their formation from both
    observational and theoretical standpoints.
</p>

<h2>Goals of the Workshop</2>

<p>
    We aim to develop, as a community, a roadmap for the kinematical detection
    of planets while still embedded in their protoplanetary disk, including what
    observations, simulations and other resources we need. We want to define what
    signatures we should be searching for and <strong>what constitutes a detection</strong>
    of a planet. Similarly, we need to understand <strong>what simulations are needed</strong> to
    interpret these observations, what are the essential physics which must be
    included?
</p>

<h2>Registration of Interest</h2>

<p>
    Please use this <a href="https://goo.gl/forms/irWRbfo26M7d6c2C2">Google form</a>
    to register your interest in joining this workshop. As numbers are limited,
    if we exceed the number of participants the SOC will attempt to select a
    diverse group of participants with a breadth of scientific interests and
    career stages.
</p>

<h2>Schedule and Location</h2>

<p>
    <i>Visualizing The Kinematics of Planet Formation</i> workshop will take
    place from October 21 to October 25, 2019 at the <a href="https://www.simonsfoundation.org/flatiron/">Flatiron Institute</a>
    in New York City.
</p>

<p>
    The workshop will be free to participate with both breakfast and lunch
    provided at the CCA. Participants will be required to fund their own travel
    and accommodation. If your attendance is dependent on funding, please
    indicate this on the application form as we do have a small discretionary
    fund.
</p>

<h2>Scientific Organizing Committee</h2>

<p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Phil Armitage</strong> (Flatiron/Stony Brook)</li>
    <li><strong>Jaehan Bae</strong> (Carnegie DTM)</li>
    <li><strong>Ted Bergin</strong> (UMich)</li>
    <li><strong>Dan Foreman-Mackey</strong> (Flatiron)</li>
    <li><strong>Rich Teague</strong> (UMich)</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h2>Collaboration Policy</h2>

<p>
To ensure transparency and openness, we have adopted the
<a href="http://gaia.lol/codeofconduct.html">collaboration policy developed
for the Gaia Sprints</a> which has been used successfully in many similar
workshops. This policy requires that participants agree to the following:
</p>

<p>
All participants will be expected to openly share their ideas, expertise, code,
and interim results. Project development will proceed out in the open, among
participants and in the world.
</p>

<p>
Participants will be encouraged to change gears, start new collaborations, and
combine projects. Any participant who contributes significantly to a project
can expect co-authorship on resulting scientific papers, and any participant
who gets significant contributions to a project is expected to include those
contributors as co-authors.
</p>

<p>
These rules make it <i>inadvisable to bring proprietary data sets or
proprietary code</i>, unless the participant bringing such assets has the
rights to open them or add collaborators.
</p>

<h2 id="codeofconduct">Code of Conduct</h2>

<p>
We are dedicated to providing a harassment-free conference experience for
everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual
orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity,
religion (or lack thereof), or technology choices. We do not tolerate
harassment, abusive behavior, or intimidation of conference participants in any
form. As such, we follow the <a href="https://aas.org/ethics">AAS Code of
Ethics</a>, and expect all participants to read and abide by the statements
in the <a href="https://aas.org/ethics">AAS Code of Ethics</a>.
